description: "Tales of Three Hemispheres is a collection of fantasy short stories\
  \ by Lord Dunsany. The first edition was published in Boston by John W. Luce & Co.\
  \ in November, 1919; the first British edition was published in London by T. Fisher\
  \ Unwin in June, 1920.\nThe collection's significance in the history of fantasy\
  \ literature was recognized by its republication in a new edition by Owlswick Press\
  \ in 1976, with illustrations by Tim Kirk and a foreword by H. P. Lovecraft, actually\
  \ a general article on Dunsany's work originally written by Lovecraft in 1922, but\
  \ unpublished until it appeared in his posthumous Marginalia (Arkham House, 1944).\n\
  The book collects 14 short pieces by Dunsany; the last three, under the general\
  \ heading \"Beyond the Fields We Know,\" are related tales, as explained in the\
  \ publisher's note preceding the first, \"Idle Days on the Yann,\" which was previously\
  \ published in the author's earlier collection A Dreamer's Tales, but reprinted\
  \ in the current one owing to the relationship.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
